  path variable
  error
  
  touch file{1..5}.txt

  -terminating processes-
  kill
  kill -9 1234
  killall
  killall firefox
  
  -----cat, more || less-----
  cat - prints out the contents fully (gotta scroll up)
  more - lets you space+tab through until the end (b goes back)
  less - gives a brief synopsis of a file
  q - quit
  
  -----head and tail-----
  head - print first 10 lines of a file
  tail - print last 10 lines of a file
  
  -----finding files and dirs------
  find - search for files, by defalt only looks in current directory

    -printf - prints the ouput to the screen
      -EX: find -empty -printf "%i\n"
        -%1 will specifiy the number that the file is in memory(\n is newline of course)
  whereis/locate - returns location of file with name
  which - look through past directories
  
-----good ol' grep-----
search for patterns in a file, print the line (only the line) with that pattern.
grep supports files, no need to cat the file.
EX: grep --help | grep grep
  - print the help page for grep, then redirects that to a grep cmd that greps the lines with 'grep' in them
  -- -i = nocase
  -- in prints with lines numbers
  -- C5 prints five lines bofa directions
  -- A5 prints five after
  -- B5 prints 5 before
  -- egrep - search for patterns using regex
  ----EX: egrep "student|root|steve" /etc/passw
  -- ^[ - beginning of a line
  
  ---cut---
  cut - remove sections from each line of files
  -d - delimiter (this is what separates the fields)
  -f - fields
  -c - characters
  -s - only delimited (only prints the lines that contain the delimiter character)
  --output-delimiter = changes your delimiter
  EX: cut -d: -f1,6 - delimits line by ':' and prints fields 1 through 6.
