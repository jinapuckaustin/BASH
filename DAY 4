~~~~~the standard for loop~~~~~
the for loop iterates over a list of items and performs the given set of commands. the bash for loop takes the following form:

Pseudo-code:
for item in LIST

do 

commands

done

DEMEX: 
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}
do
  echo $i
done

~~~Break and continue~~~
~ Break ~ terminates the current loop and passes program control to the statement that follows the terminated statement.
synEX: if [[  <condition>  ]]; then
  break
~ continue ~ statement exits the current iteration of a loop and passes program control to the next iteration of the loop.

~~~while and until loop~~~
while loop ~ performs a given set of commands an unknown number of times as long as the given condition evaluates to true

SYNEX:
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
while [[ $counter -le 10 ]]
do
  echo $counter
  ((counter++))
done
echo "All done!"

until loop ~ execute a given set of commands as long as the given condtion evaluates to false

SYNEX:
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
until [[ $counter -gt 10 ]]
do
  echo $counter
  ((counter++))
done
echo "All done!"
